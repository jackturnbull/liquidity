# GET Liquidity Mining
> I want to put my GET into something so I earn more GET ðŸ“ˆ

Possible, but there are some rules. First start by reading the [official announcement](https://medium.com/get-protocol/the-get-liquidity-mining-program-55cc50c4bb7e).

## What rules?
Well first off, you arenâ€™t just earning GET on top of the GET you own. In order to earn the rewards you need to put it to work. Just owning GET doesnâ€™t provide value, you need to make it provide value. And you do this through providing /liquidity/ to the GET/ETH pair on Uniswap.

Uniswap is an exchange, where people trade one asset for another. Some people want to buy GET and some people want to sell it, and the most common pairing is GET & ETH. This means that most people that want to buy GET sell their ETH, and most people that want to sell their GET want ETH in return. But in order for people to buy and sell GET there needs to be [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp). To provide liquidity in Uniswap you provide equal amounts of both GET & ETH and you allow people to trade against both of your assets. In essence you place your GET & ETH into a pool of assets, and allow other people to trade against it, earning you trading fees and rewards in return.

This isnâ€™t risk free. Whenever someone trades against this pool, the assets balance of the pool changes. If someone sells a large amount of GET, it means they are inserting GET into the pool and withdrawing ETH, so your allocation will follow. If you go to withdraw then youâ€™ll receive more ETH than you put in and fewer GET. In some cases this drift can end up being worse than just holding your original two assets. This is called [Impermanent Loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained).

To help counter the risks of impermanent loss to those that provide funds to the GET/ETH pool, the GET Foundation (that run the project) provide rewards to liquidity providers to help lessen the risk.

## What are the rewards?
If you provide liquidity to the pool, you receive an amount of GET proportional to your total liquidity of the pool every two weeks.

These rewards earn around 30% APY.

Uniswap also charges a 0.3% fee on trades and is rewarded to liquidity providers. This adds around 8% APY on top of the rewards.

And since this is denominated in GET and ETH, you also earn any appreciation against the dollar when you come to sell these assets. GET or ETH can appreciate by 2x or 3x, and your rewards are still primarily paid in GET so these will appreciate as well. You grow your stack without additional investment.

## How do I do it?
If you only have a single asset, then â€˜supplyâ€™ into the [Uniswap GET/ETH Pool using Zerion](https://app.zerion.io/invest/asset/UNI-V2-0x2680a95fc9de215f1034f073185cc1f2a28b4107). 

If you already have GET and ETH then directly adding liquidity on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x8a854288a5976036a725879164ca3e91d30c6a1b/ETH) is recommended, albeit slightly more technical.

Lets say that you have a stack of ETH already and you want to enter the pool, Zerion will sell half of that ETH for GET, and then place them both in equal amounts into the pool. Since it has to go through an additional hop the fees will be marginally higher, but it is the least difficult.

If you already have GET and ETH in roughly equal amounts, you can supply these using the Uniswap link above. It is worth [reading up on the process](https://defiprime.com/uniswap-explained#how-do-i-add-liquidity-to-uniswap) before diving in head first. Uniswap should be available from within the [Coinbase Wallet app](https://defiprime.com/uniswap-explained#how-do-i-add-liquidity-to-uniswap).

## Tips?
* Keeping fees to a bare minimum is essential to maximising returns. [Coinbase Pro](https://pro.coinbase.com/) is cheaper than regular Coinbase (transfer your Coinbase funds from within Coinbase pro). [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) is even cheaper than Coinbase Pro.
* Keep an eye on the Ethereum [gas price](https://www.gasnow.org/) and only transact when it is low. Low these days is 80-100. Find a good point and set your gas price to the fast (or standard) value on this site.
* Transact with larger amounts less frequently.
* If buying in anew, buy ETH from an exchange and send that to your wallet. You can then buy in directly with Zerion with minimum hops needed. 

## No catch?
No, but a couple of things to be aware of:
1. Impermanent Loss is a thing. If ETH shoots up way faster than GET, then your rewards paid in GET wonâ€™t cover what you would have earned just holding your assets.
2. The GET rewards program has only been guaranteed until the end of March. It will likely be extended but there are no guarantees currently.
3. Because of congestion on Ethereum right now, getting in and out of the pool can cost upwards of $20 on occasion. Keep an eye out and enter when the [gas prices](https://www.gasnow.org/) are around the 80-100 mark for fast transactions. A gas fee too high will quickly eat into profits, so transacting in larger amounts when transaction fees are low helps keep the overall cost of funding low.
